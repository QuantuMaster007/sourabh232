I’m a **Senior Technical Program Manager (7+ years)** specializing in:

- 🛰️ **Technical program management (TPM)** for complex hardware and AI-adjacent systems  
- 📊 **Strategic financial planning & capital asset management (CapEx)** across multimillion-dollar portfolios  
- 🏭 **Manufacturing & supply chain operations**, from NPI and ramp to tooling, readiness, and optimization  

I focus on designing and implementing **models, tools, and processes** that make capital-intensive decisions more  
**clear, predictable, and scalable**—so engineering, finance, and operations can move fast *without* losing control.

## 🧠 Featured Projects

> I use these repos to showcase how I approach real-world Strategic Finance, FP&A, and TPM problems.

### 1️⃣ CapEx Forecasting Engine
**Repo:** [`capex-forecasting-engine`](https://github.com/QuantuMaster007/capex-forecasting-engine.git)  
End-to-end CapEx forecasting toolkit: driver-based model for tools, fixtures, and ramp, with scenarios, payback, and NPV/IRR analysis.

- Multi-year CapEx plan with ramp curves and depreciation
- Scenario-based modeling (base / upside / downside)
- Simple Excel & Python implementation with sample data

---

### 2️⃣ Supply Chain Control
**Repo:** [`supply-chain-control`](https://github.com/QuantuMaster007/supply-chain-control.git)  
An executive **end-to-end supply chain governance** + interactive **Power BI control tower** dashboard to surface late-risk, shortage exposure, and recovery actions.

* **Executive KPI suite:** OTIF, Past Due $, Commit Slip, Reschedule Rate, Expedite Spend, Quality Holds
* **Supplier performance drilldowns:** heatmaps + pareto/treemap to isolate top late-$ drivers
* **Commit health & volatility tracking:** reschedule churn + lead time drift to predict misses early
* **Inbound logistics view:** mode/carrier/lane performance + expedite burn (if data available)
* **Readiness & shortage early-warning:** time-phased coverage (next 6 weeks) + critical-path hotlist
* **Case-study portfolio:** 5 realistic stories showing root cause → actions → measurable recovery outcomes

### 3️⃣ FP&A Driver-Based Planning Template
**Repo:** [`fpna-driver-based-planning-template`](https://github.com/your-username/fpna-driver-based-planning-template)  
A reusable template for **driver-based P&L / OpEx / CapEx planning**.

- Input tabs for drivers (headcount, volume, rates)
- Output tabs for P&L and cash flow
- Ready to plug into Anaplan/Adaptive-style workflows

---

### 4️⃣ Scenario Planning Toolkit
**Repo:** [`scenario-planning-toolkit`](https://github.com/QuantuMaster007/scenario-planning-toolkit.git)  
A lightweight toolkit for building and comparing multiple financial scenarios.

- Base / Upside / Downside frameworks
